# Research Findings: JSON Formatter Web App

## Build Process for GitHub Pages

### Decision: Use Vite for simple, fast JavaScript bundling

**Rationale:**
- Vite provides excellent development experience with hot module replacement
- Built-in TypeScript support (if needed later)
- Optimized production builds with tree-shaking
- Simple configuration for static site generation
- Excellent GitHub Pages integration with minimal setup

**Alternatives considered:**
- Webpack: More complex configuration, larger bundle overhead
- Rollup: Lower-level, requires more manual configuration
- No build tool: Would work but lacks optimization and development features
- Parcel: Good alternative but Vite has better ecosystem support

**Implementation:**
- Use `vite build` for production builds
- Configure `base` option for GitHub Pages subdirectory if needed
- Output to `dist/` directory for GitHub Pages deployment

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Decision: Simple static site deployment with GitHub Pages action

**Rationale:**
- GitHub's official `actions/deploy-pages` action is well-maintained
- Minimal configuration required
- Automatic deployment on push to main branch
- Built-in caching and optimization

**Alternatives considered:**
- Manual deployment: Too error-prone and time-consuming
- Third-party actions: Unnecessary complexity for static site
- Custom deployment script: Overkill for simple static site

**Implementation:**
```yaml
- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
  uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
  with:
    artifact_name: github-pages
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Performance Optimization with Web Workers

### Decision: Implement Web Workers for JSON processing over 100KB

**Rationale:**
- Prevents UI blocking during large JSON processing
- Maintains responsive user experience
- Modern browsers have excellent Web Worker support
- Can be implemented progressively (graceful degradation)

**Alternatives considered:**
- No Web Workers: Would cause UI freezing with large files
- setTimeout batching: More complex and less reliable
- Service Workers: Overkill for this use case

**Implementation:**
- Create `json-worker.js` for background processing
- Use `postMessage` for communication between main thread and worker
- Fallback to synchronous processing for smaller files
- Implement progress indicators for large file processing

## Accessibility Patterns for JSON Input/Output

### Decision: Use proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

**Rationale:**
- Follows WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
- Ensures screen reader compatibility
- Improves overall user experience
- Required for professional web applications

**Implementation:**
- Use `<textarea>` with `aria-label` for JSON input
- Use `<pre>` with `role="textbox"` and `aria-readonly="true"` for output
- Add `aria-describedby` to connect error messages
- Implement proper focus management and keyboard navigation
- Use `aria-live` regions for dynamic content updates

**ARIA Pattern:**
```html
<textarea
  id="json-input"
  aria-label="JSON input"
  aria-describedby="input-help"
  role="textbox">
</textarea>
<pre
  id="json-output"
  role="textbox"
  aria-readonly="true"
  aria-label="Formatted JSON output">
</pre>
```

## Error Handling Patterns

### Decision: User-friendly error messages with visual indicators

**Rationale:**
- Improves user experience with clear feedback
- Reduces confusion and support requests
- Follows modern UX patterns
- Maintains application stability

**Implementation:**
- Catch JSON.parse errors and display friendly messages
- Use visual error states (red borders, error icons)
- Provide suggestions for common JSON errors
- Implement error recovery (highlight problematic areas)
- Use consistent error styling and positioning

**Error Message Examples:**
- "Invalid JSON: Missing closing bracket"
- "Invalid JSON: Unexpected character at position 15"
- "Invalid JSON: Trailing comma not allowed"

## Additional Research Findings

### CSS Framework Decision: Vanilla CSS with CSS Custom Properties

**Rationale:**
- Keeps bundle size minimal
- Full control over styling
- No external dependencies
- Easy to customize and maintain

### Testing Strategy Decision: Jest + Testing Library

**Rationale:**
- Jest provides excellent JavaScript testing capabilities
- Testing Library focuses on user-centric testing
- Good integration with modern development workflows
- Comprehensive mocking and assertion capabilities

### Browser Support Strategy: Progressive Enhancement

**Rationale:**
- Ensures basic functionality works everywhere
- Enhances experience on modern browsers
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Maintains accessibility across all supported browsers
