# JSON Formatter Constitution

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Ratified:** 2024-12-19
**Last Amended:** 2024-12-19

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the fundamental principles and governance framework for the JSON Formatter project. All development activities, decisions, and contributions must align with these principles to ensure project coherence, quality, and long-term sustainability.

## Core Principles

### Simplicity First
All solutions MUST prioritize simplicity over complexity. When multiple approaches exist, choose the most straightforward option that meets requirements. Avoid over-engineering, premature optimization, and unnecessary abstractions.

**Rationale:** Simple solutions are easier to understand, maintain, debug, and extend. They reduce cognitive load for developers and users, leading to fewer bugs and faster development cycles.

### Best Practices Adherence
All code, documentation, and processes MUST follow established industry standards and proven patterns. This includes coding conventions, architectural patterns, testing strategies, and development workflows.

**Rationale:** Following best practices ensures consistency, reduces technical debt, improves code quality, and makes the project more accessible to new contributors who are familiar with standard approaches.

### Quality Focus
All deliverables MUST meet high quality standards while maintaining simplicity. This includes comprehensive testing, clear documentation, proper error handling, and performance considerations.

**Rationale:** High quality ensures reliability and user trust, while the simplicity principle ensures quality measures don't become overly complex or burdensome to maintain.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
Constitution amendments require:
1. Proposal with clear rationale and impact assessment
2. Review period of at least 48 hours
3. Consensus approval from project maintainers
4. Version increment following semantic versioning

### Versioning Policy
- **MAJOR (X.0.0):** Backward incompatible changes to principles or governance
- **MINOR (X.Y.0):** Addition of new principles or significant expansion of existing ones
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z):** Clarifications, typo fixes, or minor refinements

### Compliance Review
All project artifacts, including code, documentation, and processes, must be reviewed for constitution compliance during:
- Pull request reviews
- Release planning
- Quarterly project retrospectives

## Enforcement

Violations of constitutional principles must be addressed through:
1. Immediate identification and documentation
2. Remediation plan development
3. Implementation timeline establishment
4. Verification of compliance restoration
